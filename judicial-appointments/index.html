                <h2>Trump's Judicial Appointments: A Lasting Legacy</h2>
                <p>During his four years in office, President Donald Trump appointed a total of 279 federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices. This represents a historic transformation of the federal judiciary, with a focus on appointing judges who are committed to a textualist and originalist interpretation of the Constitution. This section explores the significance of these appointments and their lasting impact on the nation.</p>

                            <p>Justice Gorsuch is a proponent of textualism and originalism. His nomination was a fulfillment of President Trump's promise to appoint a successor to Justice Antonin Scalia who shared his judicial philosophy.</p>

                            <p>Justice Kavanaugh's nomination was highly contentious, but his confirmation solidified a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. He is known for his textualist approach to statutory interpretation.</p>
